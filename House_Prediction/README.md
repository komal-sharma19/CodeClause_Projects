## 👩‍💻 Intern
**Komal Sharma**

## 🗓️ Timeline
- **Start Date:** 01 July 2025
- **End Date:** 01 July 2025 (completed)

## 🎯 Aim
Build a **simple linear regression model** to predict house prices based on:
- Number of Bedrooms
- Square Footage (Area)

---

## 📝 Description
Using a **Kaggle Housing Prices dataset**, this project:
- Performs exploratory data analysis.
- Uses **Linear Regression (Scikit-Learn)** to model the relationship between features and price.
- Evaluates using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score**.
- Visualizes Actual vs Predicted prices and residuals distribution.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Scikit-Learn**

---

## 📊 Outputs
- **MSE and R² Score** to evaluate the model.
- Scatter plot: *Actual vs Predicted Prices*.
- Histogram: *Residuals Distribution*.
